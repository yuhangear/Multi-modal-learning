WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE THOUGHT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)

A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFILLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD LIKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)

SOON ENOUGH HE WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY MOTHER'S PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT ON A DEMANDS IS THE CARRIAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)

NO THAT ON THE PLAIN OF PARIS YONDER I HAVE TWO FAR BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OPPRESS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SHOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETOR GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD UP TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF HIS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS SATISIDITIES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
COUNTESS AND MOUSE WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT IT MEDICINES EVER SMILING FACE AND EVERATING BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE A MEADOW SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMEDUS HAVING LOVE OF ALCASTUS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND IT MEDICINE KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNED TO A MEDICINE A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MY NOPOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID NED MEDICINE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT STILL APOLER STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE AT ONCE IN SPEAKING TO A MEDICINE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
AT MEDICINE AT MEDICINE HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS TO ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO ME AT MEDICINE AND MEDICINE NO THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF GOD WORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO AT MEDICINE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURT YARD DRIVING IN CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SIGN AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MAGIC HARE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KEEN AND GO WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
AT MEDICINE TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN AT MEDICE WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBERS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMMON FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF LANDWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND THE HOUSE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
IN THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED OFF CAST HIS STRONG BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETERS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCASTUS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HAROCLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOUR WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS SOUND INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF RED MEADOWS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF LANDWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED AND A MEDICINE COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ONE MEDICINE I'VE HAD PAINS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN AT MATTERS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT HOME TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT A DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HEED TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN AT THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTON SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY MOUNTSARION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS STOOD BY THE MEN THE STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WILL SHOW ME YOUR THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD FLEE FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES ITS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THESE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THEY YOUR NECKS SOUGHT MADE COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO HE SENT ME CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS A SLOPES LAID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELLING AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BROAD WEAPONS CAME PAIN AND ONE OF THEM SAID PLEASE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THINE SCENES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLAY IS THIS LAST CRIES LAST TWO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VEIL WHERE HE SAW FREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
PRUSSAN SIRS LENDS COME YOU AND WHERE DO GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FOR MODEST AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF FAMED LORRY AND OUR OWN OUR WAY TO MOUNDS DINE FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOWING NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT A DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEVE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARED ON THIS POOR FOR LONG YEARS HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SILVER YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE GETTING THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ACTS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HEEL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP HEW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HUGH AND THOSE WHO CAME BY MY REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMOR SAT THATIZING WAS FOR HIM THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MOREISH SO DONE GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FOR A CHEST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREYING OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TIER OUR LIBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MAN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS THROAT FOR HIS CROW THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PIECE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FOUND DAWN ON HIS KNEES TO BRAVE THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACEFUL DIS ACT AND THEN WHEN BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS CROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
HO FOR THAT I AM SAID TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO THEY GAVE WAY TO THE FLASH AS TO USE FOR EASE THAT REST WHICH LORDA FOR HUGH HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEY ARE SEEN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE GREAT SEA AND I AM MADE TO TRY THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROTTED WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE SLEEP	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
SO FORM AND I HAVE BEING ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE BAY ONCE MORE WHEREFORE SPELL HE SAID DYING WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SET GLANCE AT FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SKULL WHICH HE CAUGHT IT WITH HASTE AND PUTTING HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY IF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HATH GOT BACK HIS ROW	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID ENOUGH IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LISTA DID HE NOW CLEAN THE HUE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
HA THOUGHT HE THESE BEATS RANGING THAT NOT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MEN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE HELP AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK AND CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS BY STRENGTH SO'S FULL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT EAR TO TRY TO FAITH OF THOSE BETH HABIT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HATH KNOWN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP THEE THE BEAST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STEEL HE WENT ON IN GRAY DREAD OF THE WIDE BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR IT THEY DID BE NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY THOUGH HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LOT WHERE A WATCHFUL DOUBT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
BRISTIN SIR WHAT HOUSE IT IS MAY REST HERE TO NIGHT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY QUESTION HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITHIN TO HIS HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
HEIGHTY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS AS TO TAKE FEELING TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU A FOOL THAT SHOULD HAVE SEEN ALL YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WAS A RIOT GOOD WIDOW AND I AM GLAD THAT SHE SHOULD ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT NATION WISH TILL MUCH GO TO MONKHAIM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL GROW WITH SUCH AS NOT THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES FORTUNE YES I HAVE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HALF MAY LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH HIS FRIENDS TO THE ROOM DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST INTO LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TO A BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SAT HE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JOHN BONE OF THE NASP WITH WHICH SAMSONED SUCH WAY FEASTS AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DABBAT SLEW GONIA OF DEATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WASH THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WILL SEEM MANUOUS LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEING HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD OR I NOW HIS CHURCH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
JOE THOU JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STOOP THAT IS HERE BUT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SOME OF THE KINGS SPOKE THIS YOU SAY THIS MAN WHO HAST MADE SUCH A STIRRING NOW AT TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHY WHEN MUST HE'S LACK FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS BATH THE TREAD OF SAME WAY WAS CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HELPFUL SAID COMMISSION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO THEY SAT OFF THROUGH THE FIELD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAVE MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HATE CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IN HIS POOR HOUR GOES	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SET DOWN DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU'D LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN THOUGHT	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND BY BESACK WE COULD OUR SO AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BE MASTER OR A MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENTS MEN HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MEN HAD ESPADE NOTHING DISADE HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SUDDENLY DISAPPROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALL WAS GOVERNS IN FEAR OF THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY DISAPPROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHAT AVERAGE PART IS PAID IS SUBJECTED WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE A SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HIRE ON THIS KIND HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MEN AS NEITHER AT PRESS NOR THEY FOR THEIR REASON ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF THOUGHT WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAIN ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED IT THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ENEMIES WOULD HAVE A BIT MEN OF THEIR OWN COURT AS IN THE PRESENT DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEYING	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WILL SEEM THAT IN THE SAMENESS MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE IT WOULD HAVE A BID MEN IN THE STATE OF AMISSES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS FITTING THE STATE OF LESSONS MAN HADN'T BEEN IN OVER PENS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW A MERE REASON HAST POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUADITY AT LEAST AS REGARD SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSATIVE SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEX UNION HAVE BEEN STERO	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BUTTED IN DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
EQUALITY MIGHT ALSO RISE ON THE PARTS OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECTIVE NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT'LL SEEM THAT A MISTAKE OF MEDICINES MAN WOULD NOT HAPPY MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF AMUSEMENT MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECTIVE MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN OTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CUT A MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF OFFICES BETWEEN MEN AND MEN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN NO INVISIBLE AGE	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0000)
ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED ITS FIRSTING PERFECT BUT IN THE SAME FENOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGUN BY GENERATION	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0001)
THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAPPEN IN PERFECT EMBODIING SIZE AND POWER	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0002)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WITH HAPPY IN COMEDY WITH MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0003)
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VANBRADD IS IN PRESENT FOR DEBT I SAID	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0000)
AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HOPELESS	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0001)
HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0002)
HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US	(8173-294714-8173-294714-0003)
