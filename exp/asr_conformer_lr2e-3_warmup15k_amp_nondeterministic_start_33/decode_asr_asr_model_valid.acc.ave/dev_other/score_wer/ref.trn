AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREETS ASTIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WENDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER	(116-288045-116-288045-0000)
LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY	(116-288045-116-288045-0001)
HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED TO TENDER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE	(116-288045-116-288045-0002)
WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SILENTLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES	(116-288045-116-288045-0003)
OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIENDLY GUIDE	(116-288045-116-288045-0004)
YES HE ANSWERED I CONDUCT THE WORSHIP I AM A PRIEST	(116-288045-116-288045-0005)
AN IDOL I WHISPERED TAKEN BY SURPRISE	(116-288045-116-288045-0006)
THEY WORSHIPPED GODS THAT DID NOT EXIST	(116-288045-116-288045-0007)
BUT THE GREEKS LOVED THEIR GODS I PROTESTED MY HEART CLAMORING IN MY BREAST	(116-288045-116-288045-0008)
NO I SAID IN A LOW VOICE	(116-288045-116-288045-0009)
HE WAS AN IDOL THEN AND NOT A GOD	(116-288045-116-288045-0010)
IT MADE ATHENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREATED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE	(116-288045-116-288045-0011)
IT HAD ONLY ONE FAULT INTERRUPTED MY GUIDE WHAT WAS THAT	(116-288045-116-288045-0012)
I INQUIRED WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE	(116-288045-116-288045-0013)
PRODUCE HIM	(116-288045-116-288045-0014)
I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMY	(116-288045-116-288045-0015)
THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO'S RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING THE DIVINE APOLLO	(116-288045-116-288045-0016)
DO YOU DOUBT HOMER	(116-288045-116-288045-0017)
I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD	(116-288045-116-288045-0018)
NO NO APOLLO IS NOT AN IDOL	(116-288045-116-288045-0019)
HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD	(116-288045-116-288045-0020)
THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES	(116-288045-116-288045-0021)
OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTHDAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SAVIOR JESUS THE SON OF GOD	(116-288045-116-288045-0022)
FORGET APOLLO HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE	(116-288045-116-288045-0023)
THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN IDOL	(116-288045-116-288045-0024)
IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO IN ALL THE UNIVERSE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION	(116-288045-116-288045-0025)
I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTENED TURNING TOWARD HIM	(116-288045-116-288045-0026)
WILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING	(116-288045-116-288045-0027)
WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN	(116-288045-116-288045-0028)
WILL HE NOT PERMIT THEM TO TOUCH HIM TO CARESS HIS HAND TO CLASP HIS DIVINE FEET TO INHALE THE AMBROSIAL FRAGRANCE OF HIS BREATH TO BASK IN THE GOLDEN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUSIC OF HIS IMMACULATE ACCENTS	(116-288045-116-288045-0029)
I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT	(116-288045-116-288045-0030)
WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURED TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JESUS AS MUCH OF AN IDOL AS APOLLO	(116-288045-116-288045-0031)
AND IF FAITH THAT JESUS IS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN APOLLO MAKE HIM A GOD	(116-288045-116-288045-0032)
BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS	(116-288046-116-288046-0000)
BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDID DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES	(116-288046-116-288046-0001)
I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTHY OF FAITH	(116-288046-116-288046-0002)
IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM	(116-288046-116-288046-0003)
OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT DOES NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE	(116-288046-116-288046-0004)
NO PREACHER OR PRIEST IS MORE CONSTRUCTIVE	(116-288046-116-288046-0005)
CLAPPING TRUTH INTO JAIL GAGGING THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THAT BUILDING UP OR TEARING DOWN	(116-288046-116-288046-0006)
WHEN BRUNO LIGHTED A NEW TORCH TO INCREASE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE	(116-288046-116-288046-0007)
COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BY THE PRIEST	(116-288046-116-288046-0008)
I WISH TO TELL YOU SOMETHING	(116-288046-116-288046-0009)
BUT FIRST LET US BE IMPERSONAL THE EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER ATHEIST AND INFIDEL ARE FLUNG AT A MAN NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY	(116-288046-116-288046-0010)
NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OR THE INDUSTRY OF OUR NEIGHBOR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WETTING THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSHING INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WE EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES	(116-288046-116-288046-0011)
A MYTH IS A FANCIFUL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON	(116-288047-116-288047-0000)
THE MIND CRAVES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKS QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW	(116-288047-116-288047-0001)
NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER	(116-288047-116-288047-0002)
WITH THIS MYTHUS THE PRIMITIVE MAN WAS SATISFIED UNTIL HIS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REALIZATION	(116-288047-116-288047-0003)
THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDOOS	(116-288047-116-288047-0004)
AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE USE TO WHICH MYTHS HAVE BEEN PUT	(116-288047-116-288047-0005)
IS JESUS A MYTH	(116-288047-116-288047-0006)
THERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR FICTION	(116-288047-116-288047-0007)
IT THINKS LESS THAN IT GUESSES	(116-288047-116-288047-0008)
IT IS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBING ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RESTLESS SPIRIT	(116-288047-116-288047-0009)
WE FILL THE SPACE ABOUT AND OVER US WITH SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AND AIRY BEINGS	(116-288047-116-288047-0010)
WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON	(116-288047-116-288047-0011)
OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOUCH THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION	(116-288047-116-288047-0012)
SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN UNTIL MAN HAD MATURED	(116-288047-116-288047-0013)
GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE	(116-288047-116-288047-0014)
THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES AND FAITHS OF MANKIND	(116-288047-116-288047-0015)
THE SCHOOL IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE	(116-288047-116-288047-0016)
RELIGION IS THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD	(116-288047-116-288047-0017)
IN THE DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND	(116-288047-116-288047-0018)
HE IS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM	(116-288047-116-288047-0019)
THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE	(116-288047-116-288047-0020)
LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE	(116-288047-116-288047-0021)
AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP IS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAWING TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTION THE DEVOTION AND THE LABOR OF HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR A REALITY	(116-288047-116-288047-0022)
A NUMBER OF OTHER DATES WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPELS GIVE NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT	(116-288048-116-288048-0000)
YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY	(116-288048-116-288048-0001)
WHY THIS DISCREPANCY IN A HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION	(116-288048-116-288048-0002)
AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HEROD'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH	(116-288048-116-288048-0003)
WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES	(116-288048-116-288048-0004)
WHILE IT IS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION IS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR	(116-288048-116-288048-0005)
GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT AS SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON ALLOWS THUS MAKING THE CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE ZODIAC AND THE PHASES OF THE MOON	(116-288048-116-288048-0006)
THE PAGAN OESTERA HAS BECOME THE CHRISTIAN EASTER	(116-288048-116-288048-0007)
BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE ORIGIN OFFERS THE FOLLOWING METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE SCEPTICAL CELSUS ONE	(116-288048-116-288048-0008)
IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT THE MYTHUS OF JESUS	(116-288048-116-288048-0009)
THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF	(116-288048-116-288048-0010)
WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARK	(116-288048-116-288048-0011)
WHO WERE JOHN PETER JUDAS AND MARY	(116-288048-116-288048-0012)
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED	(116-288048-116-288048-0013)
IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME WITH A NEW DOCTRINE HOW IS IT THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0014)
HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH	(116-288048-116-288048-0015)
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM	(116-288048-116-288048-0016)
PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY	(116-288048-116-288048-0017)
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0018)
COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM	(116-288048-116-288048-0019)
HOW ELSE IS THIS UNANIMOUS SILENCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR	(116-288048-116-288048-0020)
HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VOTES	(116-288048-116-288048-0021)
AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED BY THE SWORD NOW AND BY HELL FIRE HEREAFTER	(116-288048-116-288048-0022)
YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT IN JESUS MOUTH	(116-288048-116-288048-0023)
ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS COULD VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIVERSE TO COURTIERS WHO HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION	(116-288048-116-288048-0024)
MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THERE WOULD BE TODAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILDLESS MOTHERS NO SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINES NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG	(116-288048-116-288048-0025)
HAVE THESE PRAYERS BEEN ANSWERED	(116-288048-116-288048-0026)
HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROPHETS THESE EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS HAVE PRODUCED	(116-288048-116-288048-0027)
AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENTS CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES	(116-288048-116-288048-0028)
THE SAME WHICH THE PREACHERS OF TODAY GIVE HE PARRIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD	(116-288048-116-288048-0029)
BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU	(116-288048-116-288048-0030)
DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID	(116-288048-116-288048-0031)
SELF EFFORT AND NOT PRAYER IS THE REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION	(116-288048-116-288048-0032)
IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORROW MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PERSONS LOVE BECOMES SOLICITOUSNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STIR FEELINGS OF REGRET AT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0000)
STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEIR MEDIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0001)
IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANY THING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0002)
AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THEIR REGULARITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0003)
NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0004)
THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0005)
THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0006)
AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0007)
TWO THREE	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0008)
FOUR FIVE	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0009)
BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0010)
HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0011)
THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WINDOW	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0012)
THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SORT WHICH RACES MIDDLE AND SIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED BY A SMALL WHIRLPOOL	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0013)
THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0014)
THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0015)
SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0016)
I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0017)
WELL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0018)
O MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0019)

AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0021)
IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0022)
THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0023)
GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT	(1255-138279-1255-138279-0024)

IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0005)
PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0006)
IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0007)
OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0008)
THEY ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0009)

IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0013)
WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0014)
I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0015)
WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0016)
IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0017)
AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN ALAS ME	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0018)
MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING	(1255-74899-1255-74899-0019)

HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0000)
BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0001)
WHY NOT HE INQUIRED	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0002)

BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0007)
MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0008)
BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0009)
YOU HAVE HEARD SO	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0010)
I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0011)
MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0012)
WAS THAT THIS EVENING	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0013)
AND THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0014)
JOCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0015)
NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0016)
IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0017)
THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0018)
THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0019)
HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0020)
HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0021)
THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0022)
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0023)
I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0024)
HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0025)
BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0026)
YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PIERSTON	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0027)
HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0028)
THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0029)
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVICE CARO	(1255-90407-1255-90407-0030)
SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0000)
HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE AVON'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0001)
AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0002)
BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0003)
BUT WAS HE ABLE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0004)
IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0005)
HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0006)
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0007)
BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0008)
RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0009)
JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0010)
SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0011)
YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0012)
DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0013)
WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0014)
IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0015)
AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0016)
I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0017)
JOCELYN PIERSTON	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0018)
O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0019)
SAID MISSUS PINE AVON WITH A START	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0020)
BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0021)
LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICHOLA PINE AVON	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0022)
SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0023)
AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0024)
HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0025)
THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0026)
THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0027)
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL	(1255-90413-1255-90413-0028)
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0000)
THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0001)
HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0002)
WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APPARATUS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0003)
POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTIMISM AS REVEALED IN INVENTION THE SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD NEEDS SOME CHECK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0004)
POSSIBLY THE LEADERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVATISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0005)
ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAD BEEN RIPENING FAST	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0006)
YET THE VERY VOGUE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0007)
A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LIGHTING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0008)
THUS IN A CURIOUS MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE RIVALRIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN A FIELD WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCES WAS INEVITABLE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0009)
HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST EDISON STATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0010)
IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FEUD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0011)
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT EDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0012)
THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0013)
THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0014)
THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARC LIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0015)
HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0016)
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROPERTIES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0017)
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0018)
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLENTY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0019)
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0020)
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNTS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHILE GENUINE INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY APATHETIC	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0021)
WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID A SMALL SUM DOWN AND THE BALANCE ON MORTGAGE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0022)
WE SOLD THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY OR THIRTY THOUSAND OF THEM	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0023)
THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PREVIOUSLY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0024)
ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED A VERY GREAT CHEAPENING WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0025)
AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLEW HOW TO DO IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0026)
I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0027)
INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO EDISON THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AN IMPORTER IN THE CHINESE TRADE WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0028)
FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS EDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THE ROACH IRON WORKS ON GOERCK STREET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0029)
TO SIGMUND BERGMANN WHO HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY WITH EDISON ON TELEPHONE APPARATUS AND PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING EDISON SPECIALTIES IN A SMALL WAY IN A LOFT ON WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES METERS SAFETY FUSES AND NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0030)
IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THE EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY LEASED THE OLD BISHOP MANSION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FOURTEENTH STREET FOR ITS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0031)
THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THAT PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS A PREMONITORY SIGN OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENTIAL AVENUE TO COMMERCE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0032)
THE EXPERIENCE WITH THE LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0033)
ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND I WENT DOWN TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT EXPLORING AROUND	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0034)
FOR THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS SIXTY FIVE WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0035)
THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY IN ITS UTTER NEGLECT OF THE CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0036)
I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A CIGAR EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THEY WOULD BREAK IT OPEN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0037)
HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MADE A SUPERIOR GRADE OF CIGARS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0038)
HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THEM MADE UP WITH HAIR AND OLD PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM IN WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THE RESULT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0039)
I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0040)
I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0041)
I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO NOTICE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0042)
SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OR NIGHTS EDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINISTS WAS REMENYI	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0043)
HE WOULD TALK WITH ME BUT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0044)
ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0045)
AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL AT SIXTY FIVE LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0046)
ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0047)
HE WOULD GO OUT AMONG THE FIRE LADDIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0048)
SPEAKING OF TELLING STORIES I ONCE GOT TELLING A MAN STORIES AT THE HARRISON LAMP FACTORY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0049)
IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALL IN FURS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0050)
I HAD NOTHING ON TO PROTECT ME AGAINST THE COLD	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0051)
THEN I GOT PLEURISY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA FOR CURE	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0052)
IT HAD MERELY ENJOYED THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND THE PERILOUS PLEASURE OF BACKING EDISON'S EXPERIMENTS	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0053)
NOW ACTIVE EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED	(1585-131718-1585-131718-0054)
LONDON ITS GUILT AND GLORY	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0000)
THEY SAY BEST MEN ARE MOLDED OUT OF FAULTS AND FOR THE MOST BECOME MUCH MORE THE BETTER FOR BEING A LITTLE BAD	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0001)
STANDING ON A BROKEN COLUMN OF THE OLD STEEPLE THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE PRIMROSE HILL WILLIAM STRUCK AN ATTITUDE OF THEATRICAL FASHION AND UTTERED THE FOLLOWING ORATORICAL FLIGHT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0002)
GLORIOUS LONDON	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0003)
SAD HOW SAD TO THINK THAT THE DAY WILL COME WHEN NOT A VESTIGE OF THIS WONDERFUL MASS OF HUMAN ENERGY SHALL REMAIN WHERE THE CRY OF THE WOLF BAT AND BITTERN SHALL ONLY BE HEARD AND NATURE AGAIN RESUME HER RUSTIC SPLENDID DESOLATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0004)
THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNY COUCHES	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0005)
WILLIAM AND MYSELF SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS REALM OUR TIRED BODIES LAY IN THE ENFOLDING ARMS OF MORPHEUS UNTIL THE PORTER KNOCKED AT OUR DOOR THE NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0006)
OUR FIRST SIGHT OF SUNRISE IN LONDON GAVE US GREAT EXPECTATIONS OF FAME AND FORTUNE FOR SURELY ALL WE HAD WAS GLOWING EXPECTATIONS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0007)
OFT EXPECTATION FAILS AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST IT PROMISES AND OFT IT HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0008)
DEUCES WON DOUBLE AND SIXES TREBLE COIN	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0009)
WILLIAM TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE DEALER FLUNG A GUINEA IN THE CENTER POT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0010)
THE POLITE JACK REPLIED ALL RIGHT SIR TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0011)
I HAVE SET MY LIFE UPON A CAST AND WILL STAND THE HAZARD OF THE DIE	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0012)
I IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS AND FOUND HIM JOKING WITH THE LANDLADY ABOUT A COUPLE OF INFANT BULL PUPS SHE WAS FONDLING IN HER CAPACIOUS LAP	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0013)
IF HE HAD DROPPED OUT OF THE CLOUDS WILLIAM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED OR SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCAL	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0014)
THE PRINTING SHOP OF FIELD WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DEVIL'S TAVERN AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0015)
JAMES BURBAGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM OF WILLIAM AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS BLUFF MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW	(1585-157660-1585-157660-0016)
IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I HAVE FELT THAT OUT THERE FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0000)
THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0001)
THEY ARE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0002)
THUS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HAS GROWN TENUOUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WEST	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0003)
THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY WITH A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL AND POLITICAL TREADMILL	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0004)
HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BUILDS WALLS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS BUILDS WALLS ACROSS HIS OWN FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM IN OTHERS LOSES HIS MORAL RIGHT TO IT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0005)
HAVE THEY ACQUIRED A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0006)
THE GREAT EPIC OF THE SOUL OF OUR PEOPLE THE MAHABHARATA GIVES US A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FULL OF THE FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0007)
WHEN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY WAS STIRRED IN OUR COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0008)
IT HARDENED INTO AN AGE OF INERT CONSTRUCTION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0009)
THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL ORDER WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY ITS INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0010)
LIFE HAS ITS INEQUALITIES I ADMIT BUT THEY ARE NATURAL AND ARE IN HARMONY WITH OUR VITAL FUNCTIONS	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0011)
BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS IN THE GRIP OF AN INELASTIC SYSTEM AND FORCIBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE LAWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0012)
WE HAVE FORCED LIVING SOULS INTO A PERMANENT PASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MOULDING CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEIR OWN INTRINSIC DESIGN AND OF MASTERING THEIR OWN DESTINY	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0013)
OUR STUPEFACTION HAS BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALISE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING OUR STEPS FOR AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0014)
THEY WILL BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0015)
IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT ITS TRUTH AND THEREFORE GIVES RISE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE	(1630-102884-1630-102884-0016)
ON THE PRATZEN HEIGHTS WHERE HE HAD FALLEN WITH THE FLAGSTAFF IN HIS HAND LAY PRINCE ANDREW BOLKONSKI BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A GENTLE PITEOUS AND CHILDLIKE MOAN	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0000)
SUDDENLY HE AGAIN FELT THAT HE WAS ALIVE AND SUFFERING FROM A BURNING LACERATING PAIN IN HIS HEAD	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0001)
WAS HIS FIRST THOUGHT	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0002)
HE FEEBLY MOVED HIS LEG AND UTTERED A WEAK SICKLY GROAN WHICH AROUSED HIS OWN PITY	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0003)
LIFT THIS YOUNG MAN UP AND CARRY HIM TO THE DRESSING STATION	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0004)
PRINCE ANDREW REMEMBERED NOTHING MORE HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS FROM THE TERRIBLE PAIN OF BEING LIFTED ONTO THE STRETCHER THE JOLTING WHILE BEING MOVED AND THE PROBING OF HIS WOUND AT THE DRESSING STATION	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0005)
DURING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0006)
HE ASKED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0007)
I COMMANDED A SQUADRON REPLIED REPNIN	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0008)
PRINCE REPNIN NAMED LIEUTENANT SUKHTELEN	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0009)
AFTER LOOKING AT HIM NAPOLEON SMILED	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0010)
YOUTH IS NO HINDRANCE TO COURAGE MUTTERED SUKHTELEN IN A FAILING VOICE	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0011)
A SPLENDID REPLY SAID NAPOLEON	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0012)
PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD ALSO BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD BEFORE THE EMPEROR'S EYES TO COMPLETE THE SHOW OF PRISONERS COULD NOT FAIL TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0013)
HIS FACE SHONE WITH SELF SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0014)
THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD ICON PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN THE HOLY IMAGE	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0015)
PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BUT THE LITTLE ICON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN SUDDENLY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0016)
HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW WHERE TO SEEK FOR HELP IN THIS LIFE AND WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER IT BEYOND THE GRAVE	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0017)
HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SAY LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0018)
EITHER TO A POWER INDEFINABLE INCOMPREHENSIBLE WHICH I NOT ONLY CANNOT ADDRESS BUT WHICH I CANNOT EVEN EXPRESS IN WORDS THE GREAT ALL OR NOTHING SAID HE TO HIMSELF OR TO THAT GOD WHO HAS BEEN SEWN INTO THIS AMULET BY MARY	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0019)
THE STRETCHERS MOVED ON	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0020)
THE QUIET HOME LIFE AND PEACEFUL HAPPINESS OF BALD HILLS PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0021)
HE IS A NERVOUS BILIOUS SUBJECT SAID LARREY AND WILL NOT RECOVER	(1630-141772-1630-141772-0022)
IT IS AT THE FOOT OF WOMAN THAT WE LAY THE LAURELS THAT WITHOUT HER SMILE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN GAINED IT IS HER IMAGE THAT STRINGS THE LYRE OF THE POET THAT ANIMATES OUR VOICE IN THE BLAZE OF ELOQUENT FACTION AND GUIDES OUR BRAIN IN THE AUGUST TOILS OF STATELY COUNCILS	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0000)
IS THERE NO HOPE FOR THEM SO FULL OF HOPE	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0001)
IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0002)
THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN OCCUR FLITS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEATH OBSCURING ALL OUR GAY FANCIES WITH ITS BAT LIKE WING AND TAINTING THE HEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF OUR HAPPINESS WITH ITS VENOMOUS EXPIRATIONS	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0003)
MINE OWN	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0004)
WHAT DID WHAT COULD YOU DO	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0005)
I BEAT ABOUT MY CHAMBER LIKE A SILLY BIRD IN A CAGE	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0006)
DO NOT THINK OF MOVING TO DAY	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0007)
DO NOT KEEP THE MESSENGER AN INSTANT	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0008)
HE IS ON MY PONY	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0009)
WRITE ONLY ONE WORD TO YOUR OWN HENRIETTA	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0010)
FERDINAND TO HENRIETTA	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0011)
GOD BLESS YOU MY HENRIETTA MY BELOVED MY MATCHLESS HENRIETTA	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0012)
WHAT HAS THAT SEPARATION NOT COST ME	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0013)
PANGS THAT I COULD NOT CONCEIVE ANY HUMAN MISERY COULD OCCASION	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0014)
AND YET I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT HE WAS UNINJURED LAST NIGHT	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0015)
I DARE NOT NOW OWN HOW FOOLISH I WAS	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0016)
DO NOT BE ANGRY WITH YOUR HENRIETTA BUT I AM NERVOUS ABOUT CONCEALING OUR ENGAGEMENT FROM PAPA	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0017)
DAYS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE YOU CAN REACH BATH AND I KNOW FERDINAND I KNOW YOUR OFFICE IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN YOU WILL CONFESS	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0018)
BUT COME BACK MY OWN AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND WRITE TO ME AT THE POST OFFICE AS YOU SETTLED	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0019)
THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT YOU ARE SO NEAR MAKES ME RESTLESS	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0020)
I WISH TO MEET HIM WITH AS MUCH CALMNESS AS I CAN COMMAND	(1630-73710-1630-73710-0021)
THAT TOO SIR YOU WILL OF COURSE UNDERTAKE	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0000)
THEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HE HAS SOME SPECIAL INFORMATION SOME GREAT NEWS	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0001)
WHEN BLOCK APPEARED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE WRONG WITH HIM	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0002)
GONE NOW JUST WHEN WE MOST WANT HIM NEVER	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0003)
IDIOT TRIPLE IDIOT	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0004)
YOU SHALL BE DISMISSED DISCHARGED FROM THIS HOUR YOU ARE A DISGRACE TO THE FORCE	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0005)
IT IS THAT OR YOUR GREAT GLUTTONY	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0006)
MY GENTLEMAN MADE HIMSELF MOST PLEASANT	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0007)
WELL AT ANY RATE FOR MY SINS I ACCEPTED	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0008)
WE ENTERED THE FIRST RESTAURANT THAT OF THE REUNITED FRIENDS YOU KNOW IT PERHAPS MONSIEUR	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0009)
I HAD NO FEAR OF HIM NOT TILL THE VERY LAST WHEN HE PLAYED ME THIS EVIL TURN	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0010)
I SUSPECTED NOTHING WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT HIS POCKETBOOK IT WAS STUFFED FULL MONSIEUR I SAW THAT AND MY CONFIDENCE INCREASED CALLED FOR THE RECKONING AND PAID WITH AN ITALIAN BANK NOTE	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0011)
EXCUSE ME ONE MOMENT PRAY	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0012)
HE WENT OUT MONSIEUR AND PIFF PAFF HE WAS NO MORE TO BE SEEN	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0013)
WHY LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0014)
IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR THAT THE ITALIAN HAD BECOME INCULPATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANXIETY TO ESCAPE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0015)
HE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0016)
HAND IT ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVES HURRIEDLY	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0017)
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0018)
IT IS NO DOUBT ITALIAN	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0019)
OF COURSE SUCH A CONSUMMATE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROVED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEARCHING THE RESTAURANT OR THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OR OF MAKING INQUIRIES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0020)
IT WAS A NOTE FOR A HUNDRED LIRE A HUNDRED FRANCS AND THE RESTAURANT BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENTEEN FRANCS HAH	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0021)
HE WAS MUCH PRESSED IN A GREAT HURRY	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0022)
DIRECTLY HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CAB AND WAS DRIVING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEVIL	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0023)
HE WISHED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CAB AND WERE DRIVEN AWAY TOGETHER	(1630-96099-1630-96099-0024)
THE SOCIAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS SMOKING IN EARLY VICTORIAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CURIOUS	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0000)
NOW MISSUS QUILP HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SMOKING HUMOUR AND SHALL PROBABLY BLAZE AWAY ALL NIGHT	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0001)
BUT SIT WHERE YOU ARE IF YOU PLEASE IN CASE I WANT YOU	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0002)
THE DWARF'S TASTES HOWEVER WERE CATHOLIC	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0003)
BUT QUILP AND BRASS WERE NOT IN SOCIETY	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0004)
THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF ACTIVE OPPONENTS AND DENOUNCERS OF TOBACCO	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0005)
ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WAS THE GREAT DUKE OF WELLINGTON WHO ABOMINATED SMOKING AND WAS ANNOYED BY THE INCREASE OF CIGAR SMOKING AMONG OFFICERS OF THE ARMY	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0006)
THE LADIES HAD A KEEN SCENT FOR THE ABOMINABLE ODOUR OF TOBACCO AND DISTRUSTED THE MEN WHO SMOKED	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0007)
HERE IS FITZ BOODLE'S OR THACKERAY'S COMMENT ON IT WHAT IS THIS SMOKING THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A CRIME	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0008)
I BELIEVE IN MY HEART THAT WOMEN ARE JEALOUS OF IT AS OF A RIVAL	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0009)
I WOULD LAY A GUINEA THAT MANY A LADY WHO HAS JUST BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO READ THE ABOVE LINES LAYS DOWN THE BOOK AFTER THIS CONFESSION OF MINE THAT I AM A SMOKER AND SAYS OH THE VULGAR WRETCH AND PASSES ON TO SOMETHING ELSE	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0010)
GERMANY HAS BEEN PUFFING FOR THREE SCORE YEARS FRANCE SMOKES TO A MAN	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0011)
PSHA LOOK AT HIS PROGRESS	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0012)
THUS THE ODOUR OF TOBACCO WAS NOT BROUGHT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0013)
THE JOURNALISTS AND BOHEMIANS WHO MET AT THE COGERS WERE ABOVE OR BELOW THE DICTATES OF FASHION AND SMOKING WAS ALWAYS A FEATURE OF THEIR GATHERINGS	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0014)
BOTH QUEEN VICTORIA AND THE PRINCE CONSORT DETESTED IT SO TOBACCO WAS TABOO WHEREVER THE COURT WAS	(1650-157641-1650-157641-0015)
THE OFFICERS WERE ABOUT TO TAKE LEAVE BUT PRINCE ANDREW APPARENTLY RELUCTANT TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH HIS FRIEND ASKED THEM TO STAY AND HAVE TEA	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0000)
SEATS WERE BROUGHT IN AND SO WAS THE TEA	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0001)
THE OFFICERS GAZED WITH SURPRISE AT PIERRE'S HUGE STOUT FIGURE AND LISTENED TO HIS TALK OF MOSCOW AND THE POSITION OF OUR ARMY ROUND WHICH HE HAD RIDDEN	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0002)
SO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE POSITION OF OUR TROOPS	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0003)
NOT BEING A MILITARY MAN I CAN'T SAY I HAVE UNDERSTOOD IT FULLY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE GENERAL POSITION	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0004)
WELL THEN YOU KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE BE IT WHO IT MAY SAID PRINCE ANDREW	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0005)
AND TELL ME YOUR OPINION OF BARCLAY DE TOLLY	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0006)
PIERRE LOOKED AT TIMOKHIN WITH THE CONDESCENDINGLY INTERROGATIVE SMILE WITH WHICH EVERYBODY INVOLUNTARILY ADDRESSED THAT OFFICER	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0007)
WE SEE LIGHT AGAIN SINCE HIS SERENITY HAS BEEN APPOINTED YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID TIMOKHIN TIMIDLY AND CONTINUALLY TURNING TO GLANCE AT HIS COLONEL	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0008)
WHY SO ASKED PIERRE	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0009)
THEN WHY WAS IT FORBIDDEN	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0010)
AT SMOLENSK TOO HE JUDGED CORRECTLY THAT THE FRENCH MIGHT OUTFLANK US AS THEY HAD LARGER FORCES	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0011)
HE ORDERED US TO RETREAT AND ALL OUR EFFORTS AND LOSSES WENT FOR NOTHING	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0012)
SO IT HAS BEEN WITH BARCLAY	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0013)
WHILE RUSSIA WAS WELL A FOREIGNER COULD SERVE HER AND BE A SPLENDID MINISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEEDS ONE OF HER OWN KIN	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0014)
AND THEY SAY HE'S A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REJOINED PIERRE	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0015)
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW IRONICALLY	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0016)
A SKILLFUL COMMANDER REPLIED PIERRE	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0017)
PIERRE LOOKED AT HIM IN SURPRISE	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0018)
AND YET THEY SAY THAT WAR IS LIKE A GAME OF CHESS HE REMARKED	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0019)
THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF BODIES OF TROOPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO ANYONE	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0020)
SUCCESS NEVER DEPENDS AND NEVER WILL DEPEND ON POSITION OR EQUIPMENT OR EVEN ON NUMBERS AND LEAST OF ALL ON POSITION BUT ON WHAT THEN	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0021)
ON THE FEELING THAT IS IN ME AND IN HIM HE POINTED TO TIMOKHIN AND IN EACH SOLDIER	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0022)
A BATTLE IS WON BY THOSE WHO FIRMLY RESOLVE TO WIN IT	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0023)
WHY DID WE LOSE THE BATTLE AT AUSTERLITZ	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0024)
WE'VE LOST SO LET US RUN AND WE RAN	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0025)
BUT TOMORROW WE SHAN'T SAY IT	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0026)
BUT WHAT AWAITS US TOMORROW	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0027)
THE FACT IS THAT THOSE MEN WITH WHOM YOU HAVE RIDDEN ROUND THE POSITION NOT ONLY DO NOT HELP MATTERS BUT HINDER	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0028)
THAT'S THE TRUTH THE REAL TRUTH SAID TIMOKHIN	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0029)
IT'S NOT THE DAY FOR THAT THEY SAY	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0030)
ALL WERE SILENT THE OFFICERS ROSE	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0031)
YES YES ANSWERED PRINCE ANDREW ABSENTLY	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0032)
THE FRENCH HAVE DESTROYED MY HOME AND ARE ON THEIR WAY TO DESTROY MOSCOW THEY HAVE OUTRAGED AND ARE OUTRAGING ME EVERY MOMENT THEY ARE MY ENEMIES	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0033)
IN MY OPINION THEY ARE ALL CRIMINALS	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0034)
AND SO THINKS TIMOKHIN AND THE WHOLE ARMY	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0035)
SINCE THEY ARE MY FOES THEY CANNOT BE MY FRIENDS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN SAID AT TILSIT	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0036)
YES YES MUTTERED PIERRE LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES AT PRINCE ANDREW	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0037)
THEY TALK TO US OF THE RULES OF WAR OF CHIVALRY OF FLAGS OF TRUCE OF MERCY TO THE UNFORTUNATE AND SO ON IT'S ALL RUBBISH	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0038)
THEY PLUNDER OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES ISSUE FALSE PAPER MONEY AND WORST OF ALL THEY KILL MY CHILDREN AND MY FATHER AND THEN TALK OF RULES OF WAR AND MAGNANIMITY TO FOES	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0039)
TAKE NO PRISONERS BUT KILL AND BE KILLED	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0040)
PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD THOUGHT IT WAS ALL THE SAME TO HIM WHETHER OR NOT MOSCOW WAS TAKEN AS SMOLENSK HAD BEEN WAS SUDDENLY CHECKED IN HIS SPEECH BY AN UNEXPECTED CRAMP IN HIS THROAT	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0041)
HE PACED UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES IN SILENCE BUT HIS EYES GLITTERED FEVERISHLY AND HIS LIPS QUIVERED AS HE BEGAN SPEAKING	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0042)
AND WHEN THERE WAS A WAR LIKE THIS ONE IT WOULD BE WAR	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0043)
WHAT IS NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN WARFARE	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0044)
AND IN SPITE OF ALL THIS IT IS THE HIGHEST CLASS RESPECTED BY EVERYONE	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0045)
HOW DOES GOD ABOVE LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR THEM	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0046)
I SEE THAT I HAVE BEGUN TO UNDERSTAND TOO MUCH	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0047)
AND IT DOESN'T DO FOR MAN TO TASTE OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL AH WELL IT'S NOT FOR LONG HE ADDED	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0048)
HOWEVER YOU'RE SLEEPY AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO SLEEP	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0049)
GO BACK TO GORKI SAID PRINCE ANDREW SUDDENLY	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0050)
GO GO BEFORE A BATTLE ONE MUST HAVE ONE'S SLEEP OUT REPEATED PRINCE ANDREW	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0051)
NO HE DOES NOT WANT IT PIERRE CONCLUDED	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0052)
AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR LAST MEETING	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0053)
ONE PICTURE SUCCEEDED ANOTHER IN HIS IMAGINATION	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0054)
ON ONE OF THEM HE DWELT LONG AND JOYFULLY	(1650-167613-1650-167613-0055)
HIS MAJOR DOMO CAME IN A SECOND TIME TO SAY THAT THE FRENCHMAN WHO HAD BROUGHT THE LETTER FROM THE COUNTESS WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO SEE HIM IF ONLY FOR A MINUTE AND THAT SOMEONE FROM BAZDEEV'S WIDOW HAD CALLED TO ASK PIERRE TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S BOOKS AS SHE HERSELF WAS LEAVING FOR THE COUNTRY	(1650-173551-1650-173551-0000)
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSAGE	(1650-173551-1650-173551-0001)
THE HALL PORTER WAS STANDING AT THE FRONT DOOR	(1650-173551-1650-173551-0002)
FROM THE LANDING WHERE PIERRE STOOD THERE WAS A SECOND STAIRCASE LEADING TO THE BACK ENTRANCE	(1650-173551-1650-173551-0003)
HE WENT DOWN THAT STAIRCASE AND OUT INTO THE YARD NO ONE HAD SEEN HIM	(1650-173551-1650-173551-0004)
WHEN HE FELT HE WAS BEING LOOKED AT HE BEHAVED LIKE AN OSTRICH WHICH HIDES ITS HEAD IN A BUSH IN ORDER NOT TO BE SEEN HE HUNG HIS HEAD AND QUICKENING HIS PACE WENT DOWN THE STREET	(1650-173551-1650-173551-0005)

AND HE GREETS THEE WELL AS AN UNCLE SHOULD GREET HIS NEPHEW AND AS A VASSAL SHOULD GREET HIS LORD	(3660-172182-3660-172182-0028)
AND THE NEIGHBORING CHIEFS KNOWING THIS GROW INSOLENT TOWARDS HIM AND COVET HIS LAND AND POSSESSIONS	(3660-172182-3660-172182-0029)

AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOR TO THEM FOR GERAINT TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE	(3660-172182-3660-172182-0038)

THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0012)
AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0013)
I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0014)
IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU TO BLEED HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0015)
IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0016)
YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0017)
AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0018)
THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0019)
DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0020)
THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0021)
SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0022)
THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIER LANDI WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0023)
NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0024)
I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0025)
MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTE VARCHI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0026)
THERE THEY SEATED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0027)
MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0028)
AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKES TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT IS ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0029)
GIORGIO THE PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MAESTRO AGOSTINO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0030)
AS FIERCELY AS I COULD NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY SEAT I ASKED GIORGIO IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0031)
HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0032)
MAESTRO AGOSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS BIRD	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0033)
DONT YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT FOR MOST CERTAIN	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0034)
GIORGIO MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0035)
THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AND HE HALTED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0036)
THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MARVELLED I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS HE BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0037)
WHEN I REACHED HOME NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0038)
I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MINT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0039)
HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE YOUR VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0040)
I THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIETRO PAGOLO ADVICE ABOUT STAMPING THE COINS AND THEN WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0041)
YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALISE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0042)
YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU OUR INVETERATE FOE AND THEIR DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HAVE HAD IT TWICE IN MIND TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0043)
IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0044)
MESSER FRANCESCO USED ALSO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HIS SAINTS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DIES FOR THAT MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0045)
I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0046)
I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORENZINO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0047)
NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO TO WHOM I HAD WRITTEN WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0048)
NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0049)
I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESSED THE WORK FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0050)
THIS BEING SO AS HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0051)
I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONCE GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0052)
I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HIT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF LOADING	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0053)
I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MADE HASTE FOR ROME	(3663-172528-3663-172528-0054)
WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0000)
TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIEST IS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0001)
BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF KUANA	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0002)
HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0003)
WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0004)
WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RONIN FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIYOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0005)
NOW ALAS BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0006)
HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0007)
THEN THE RONIN SAID TO THE BOATMEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0008)
WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0009)
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONIN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0010)
WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONIN OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIYOTO	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0011)
FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0012)
SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0013)
HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0014)
AT LENGTH UNDONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOKUBEI FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0015)
NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0016)
AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVERLET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0017)
THREE YEARS AGO AT THE KUANA FERRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0018)
HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0019)
ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARDS I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0020)
THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0021)
AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0022)
REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0023)
TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0024)
BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0025)
IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0026)
FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0027)
HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0028)
BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0029)
A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF A STORK'S BEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT	(3915-57461-3915-57461-0030)
EVERY WELL ORDERED JAPANESE HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED KIND HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0000)
SHE IT IS WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL TABLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LITTLE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST DAY AND ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0001)
THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE MOTHER AS A SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0002)
VISITS TO NOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITIONS TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0003)
ALL THESE ARE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER AND PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINY OF HER SON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0004)
AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND THEY ARE USUALLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER OR CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVES THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0005)
EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK INTO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH IT PRESIDES AND ONLY A SKILLFUL BALANCER OF PROS AND CONS CAN READ ARIGHT THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR YEAR WILL BE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0006)
FOR THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE THE HOME PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN AND THE SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED IN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0007)
NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING IN WHAT DIRECTION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0008)
AFTER THIS MATTER HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0009)
OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0010)
THE HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDES WHETHER THE DAY SET BY THE BUILDER IS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0011)
A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO IN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB IN HAND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSE IS FINISHED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS ARE READY TO LEAVE IT THE LOCAL FIREMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG IN THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABORERS OFTEN ASCEND TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE RIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLE JOYFULLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0012)
ALL COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SEND SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0013)
ON THE DAY AFTER THE DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN THE CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS THE STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0014)
NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE BUT THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES THE SURVIVAL OF THE OLD TYPE A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0015)
AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0016)
THERE IS NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0017)
UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THE LAST SAD MINISTRATIONS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0018)
WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED IT IS DRESSED IN WHITE IN SILK HABUTAI WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0019)
THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN TOMBS	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0020)
THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS THAT THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0021)
THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT METAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEE THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0022)
LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BAGS OF TEA	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0023)
SO LONG AS THE COFFIN IS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0024)
IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0025)
THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING THE FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD THAT REFORM ADVANCES SLOWLY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0026)
INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0027)
A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FUKUZAWA A MAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN IN MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0028)
IN HIS WILL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING IN THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0029)
THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING AND THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THE RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0030)
JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH IS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0031)
ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS ARE SENT TO THE DEAD EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY IT	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0032)
SOMETIMES WITH THE GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TOO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRES THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCH IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0033)
ANOTHER FAVORITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED THEREON	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0034)
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BRIDAL THAN A BURIAL	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0035)
DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED IS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY	(3915-98647-3915-98647-0036)
HE TARRIED AT GENISHAU A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GARDOW WHERE I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE WINTER CAME ON AND HE CONTINUED HIS STAY	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0000)

WE PROTECTED THE POOR NANTICOKE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AND ALLEN SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES TILL SPRING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERRORS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A REFORMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF A RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTION	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0002)
THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT THE WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0003)
MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ALLEN'S HORSE AND CARRIED THE GOODS	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0004)
ALLEN ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT OF HIS RETURN THEY WERE SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTLES WHO MARRIED PRISCILLA RAMSAY WITH A SMALL PARTY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0005)
NETTLES AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND ALLEN ALL IN TATTERS CAME IN	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0006)
BY RUNNING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS SO THAT HE WAS IN A SUFFERING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0007)
ALLEN MADE HIS TROWSERS HIMSELF AND THEN BUILT A RAFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MOUNT MORRIS	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0008)
THERE AN INDIAN GAVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON TO LITTLE BEARD'S TOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQUAW	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0009)
NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARDOW	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0010)
THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CASTLE OF SAFETY	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0011)
HIS PURSUERS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETED AND UNDER MY PROTECTION	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0012)
STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THEY ADVISED MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDERED OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0013)
HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION FEARING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE	(4153-185072-4153-185072-0014)

BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGED SHE HAD SOFTENED AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO I ACCEPTED THE INVITATION	(4153-186222-4153-186222-0004)

MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHER SCOLDS HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT	(4153-186222-4153-186222-0012)
WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF HER MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO BORROW ENOUGH TO HELP HIM OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES	(4153-186222-4153-186222-0013)

IT WAS ONE MATTER FOR HER TO OBJECT TO THIS THING BILLY WAS DOING BUT QUITE ANOTHER FOR PETE TO DO IT OF COURSE IT'S SHE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0003)
RETORTED AUNT HANNAH TESTILY AS IF YOU YOURSELF DIDN'T BRING HER HERE WITH YOUR CRAZY MESSAGES AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT PETE WHERE IS HE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0004)
INTERPOSED BILLY TELL MISTER BERTRAM I AM HERE OR WAIT I'LL GO RIGHT IN AND SURPRISE HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0005)
PETE HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF BY NOW BUT HE DID NOT EVEN GLANCE TOWARD AUNT HANNAH	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0006)

PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0010)
BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0011)
A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0012)
DONG LING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0013)
IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0014)
THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0015)
AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0016)
WHY OF OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0017)
DEMANDED BERTRAM ANGRY AND MYSTIFIED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0018)
AS FOR MY NOT PAINTING AGAIN YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND PETE DEARIE	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0019)

BILLY DREW A QUIVERING SIGH	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0021)
GOOD HEAVENS IS KATE IN THIS TOO BERTRAM'S VOICE WAS SAVAGE NOW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0022)
WELL SHE WROTE A LETTER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0023)
BILLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0024)
AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0025)
HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0026)
BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0027)
AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0028)
YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0029)
AND AND YOU DIDN'T CARE SPECIALLY FOR FOR MISS WINTHROP	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0030)
BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HIS LIPS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0031)
BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0032)
WELL WHAT IS THAT IS THAT KATE TOO DEMANDED BERTRAM GRIMLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0033)
THERE WAS ANOTHER SILENCE THEN SUDDENLY BERTRAM STIRRED	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0034)
BILLY I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW HE ANNOUNCED DECISIVELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0035)
I DON'T KNOW AS I CAN TRUST YOU OUT OF MY SIGHT TILL THEN YOU'LL READ SOMETHING OR HEAR SOMETHING OR GET A LETTER FROM KATE AFTER BREAKFAST TO MORROW MORNING THAT WILL SET YOU SAVING ME AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO BE SAVED THAT WAY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0036)
I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU TO MORROW I'LL GET HE STOPPED SHORT WITH A SUDDEN FROWN CONFOUND THAT LAW I FORGOT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0037)
FIVE DAYS INDEED SIR	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0038)
I WONDER IF YOU THINK I CAN GET READY TO BE MARRIED IN FIVE DAYS	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0039)
DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0040)
IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0041)
BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BERTRAM CRAFTILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0042)
THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0043)
SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0044)
BILLY MY DEAR	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0045)
IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0046)
WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0047)
YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0048)
AUNT HANNAH GLANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNCERTAINLY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0049)
YES NODDED BILLY DEMURELY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0050)
YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM AIRILY	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0051)
WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW	(4323-55228-4323-55228-0052)
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0000)
A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0001)
TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0002)
BECAUSE IN HIS SALAD DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0003)
UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0004)
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0005)
HE WROTE TO MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0006)
WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0007)
I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFEN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0008)
BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0009)
I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0010)
POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0011)
BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0012)
WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0013)
ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0014)
I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0015)
OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0016)
PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0017)
HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0018)
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0019)
AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0020)
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0021)
IS IT SO SERIOUS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0022)
EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0023)
OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0024)
HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0025)
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0026)
THERE WAS SILENCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0027)
THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0028)
RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0029)
JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0030)
YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN MY WORK RECENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0031)
DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0032)
SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0033)
HER STORY IN THAT GIRLS PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0034)
AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0035)
I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0036)
DON'T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0037)
I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HEARTBROKEN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THEIR DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UNFAVOURABLE WHAT CAN I DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0038)
THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE I FEAR FOR MY ADVICE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0039)
WELL I'LL GO BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0040)
AGAIN JASPER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOMENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0041)
YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0042)
MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0043)
SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE HAD APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0044)
HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0045)
HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEN ADDED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0046)
THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0047)
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARIAN WHAT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0048)
YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0049)
MORE OF A BRUTE YOU MEAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0050)
YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON'T	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0051)
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0052)
YES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0053)
WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0054)
YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0055)
I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0056)
SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0057)
DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0058)
HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0059)
WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0060)
AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0061)
SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0062)
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS THE VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0063)
IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0064)
EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0065)
DO YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0066)
THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0067)
I DON'T TRUST MYSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0068)
BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILLINGLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0069)
PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0070)
WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DROP OF RAIN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0071)
EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0072)
WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0073)
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0074)
WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARIAN	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0075)
HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNCERTAINTY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0076)
I DO WISH IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0077)
HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0078)
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0079)
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0080)
IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0081)
GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0082)
I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0083)
HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0084)
MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0085)
IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0086)
BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0087)
YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0088)
HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FATE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0089)
IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0090)
BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0091)
IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0092)
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0093)
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT COMES TO	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0094)
SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0095)
WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0096)
IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0097)
MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0098)
THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0099)
THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0100)
JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0101)
ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0102)
GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN YOU CAN'T WORK	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0103)
I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0104)
GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0105)
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0106)
JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0107)
HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0108)

YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0110)
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0111)
YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0112)
SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0113)
I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH	(4515-11057-4515-11057-0114)
WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0000)
SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0001)
THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0002)
INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY	(4570-102353-4570-102353-0003)

NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0000)
IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0001)

AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0005)
IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE	(4570-14911-4570-14911-0006)

MUST NECESSARILY EXIST	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0003)
WE HAVE NOW GRANTED THEREFORE THOUGHT NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD AND ACCORDINGLY THE IDEA OF GOD DOES NOT NATURALLY FOLLOW FROM ITS NATURE IN SO FAR AS IT IS ABSOLUTE THOUGHT FOR IT IS CONCEIVED AS CONSTITUTING AND ALSO AS NOT CONSTITUTING THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS AGAINST OUR HYPOTHESIS	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0004)
AND BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE DURATION OF THE IDEA OF GOD SUPPOSING THE LATTER AT SOME TIME NOT TO HAVE EXISTED OR NOT TO BE GOING TO EXIST THOUGHT WOULD PERFORCE HAVE EXISTED WITHOUT THE IDEA OF GOD WHICH IS CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS FOR WE SUPPOSED THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN THE IDEA OF GOD NECESSARILY FLOWED THEREFROM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0005)
BEAR IN MIND THAT THE SAME PROPOSITION MAY BE AFFIRMED OF ANYTHING WHICH IN ANY ATTRIBUTE NECESSARILY FOLLOWS FROM GOD'S ABSOLUTE NATURE	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0006)
COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS NOT ONLY THE CAUSE OF THINGS COMING INTO EXISTENCE BUT ALSO OF THEIR CONTINUING IN EXISTENCE THAT IS IN SCHOLASTIC PHRASEOLOGY GOD IS CAUSE OF THE BEING OF THINGS ESSENDI RERUM	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0007)
COROLLARY INDIVIDUAL THINGS ARE NOTHING BUT MODIFICATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD OR MODES BY WHICH THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD ARE EXPRESSED IN A FIXED AND DEFINITE MANNER	(4570-24733-4570-24733-0008)

IF THIS IS SO IS IT NOT A SIGN OF ORGANIC WEAKNESS	(5543-27761-5543-27761-0066)

THE FEVER CAME UPON HER AT NIGHT	(5543-27761-5543-27761-0077)
WHEN SERAFIMA ALEKSANDROVNA AWAKENED BY FEDOSYA CAME TO LELECHKA AND SAW HER LOOKING SO HOT SO RESTLESS AND SO TORMENTED SHE INSTANTLY RECALLED THE EVIL OMEN AND A HOPELESS DESPAIR TOOK POSSESSION OF HER FROM THE FIRST MOMENTS	(5543-27761-5543-27761-0078)

THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0012)
AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION	(5849-50964-5849-50964-0013)
HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0000)
IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0001)
LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0002)
CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0003)
HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0004)
BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0005)
EVEN THE LUST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0006)
DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NEKHLUDOV IN RESURRECTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0007)
THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIOT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0008)
ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0009)
EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0010)
HE SOWS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SACK	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0011)
BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0012)
HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0013)
HE NEVER PAINTS EVERYMAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0014)
THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANNA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0015)
WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0016)
HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0017)
ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0018)
HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0019)
WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0020)
AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0021)
SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0022)
IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0023)
IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0024)
NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0025)
DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0026)
ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL EPANCHIN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETA PROKOFYEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RADOMSKY PRINCESS BYELOKONSKY AGLAIA PRINCE MYSHKIN KOLYA IVOLGIN IPPOLIT VARYA FERDYSHCHENKO NASTASYA FILIPPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA PTITSYN AND GENERAL IVOLGIN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0027)
BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0028)
MISTER MURRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0029)
TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0030)
AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0031)
ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0032)
BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0033)
THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0034)
TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0035)
THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SETEBOS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0036)
THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0037)
AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0038)
OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MYSHKIN IN THE IDIOT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0039)
HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0040)
THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0041)
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VOGUEE DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0042)
WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0043)
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0044)
THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0045)
IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS	(6123-59150-6123-59150-0046)
HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0000)
HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0001)
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY IS NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NOR SUFFICIENTLY FASTIDIOUS TO BE A GREAT POET	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0002)
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0003)
THUS HE WRITES IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0004)
THERE COULD NOT BE AN UGLIER AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION THAN IS CONTAINED IN THE IMAGE IN THE LAST LINE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0005)
AND PROSE INTRUDES IN THE CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0006)
TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM ABOUT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0007)
WHEN WE AS STRANGERS SOUGHT THEIR CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPOKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0008)
CATERING CARE IS AN APPALLING PHRASE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0009)
IS A LINE OF GOOD POETRY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0010)
YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME DREW ON AND WORE ME NUMB YET LESS FOR LOSS OF YOUR DEAR PRESENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE FOR PURE LOVING KINDNESS SAKE GRIEVED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0011)
THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LIKE IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM ARE DISCORDS THAT BRING IT TUMBLING TO THE LEVELS OF VICTORIAN COMMONPLACE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0012)
HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0013)
ONE CAN REMEMBER POEM AFTER POEM OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SERVED FOR MISTER HARDY TOO LATE CRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0014)
BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRIUMPH THERE IS IN BROWNING'S TRAGEDIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0015)
HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOT OF POVERTY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0016)
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0017)
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO HAVE DEEPENED THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0018)
FOR THEN I UNDISTREST BY HEARTS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD LONELY WAIT MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0019)
BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PART STEALS LETS PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AT EVE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0020)
AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE OF ALL MISTER HARDY'S POEMS THE OXEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0021)
WE PICTURED THE MEEK MILD CREATURES WHERE THEY DWELT IN THEIR STRAWY PEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KNEELING THEN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0022)
THE MOOD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARDY'S PREVAILING MOOD	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0023)
HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IRONICAL DOUBTS AS WE SEE IN THE SONG MEN WHO MARCH AWAY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0024)
HOW LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0025)
WHEN SHALL THE SANER SOFTER POLITIES WHEREOF WE DREAM HAVE SWAY IN EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWN GODLIKE SCORN TO STAND BONDSLAVE TO REALMS BUT CIRCLE EARTH AND SEAS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0026)
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SENIOR SOUL FLAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THEIR DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0027)
AND GENERAL HOW HOLD OUT OUR SWEETHEARTS SWORN LOYAL AS DOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0028)
SOME FICKLE AND FLEET HEARTS HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0029)
AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER RESIGNEDLY DWELL THEY ON OUR DEEDS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0030)
MISTER HARDY HAS TOO BITTER A SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0031)
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARDY IS THE WORLD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0032)
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARDY'S POEMS ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESSIVE OF TRAGIC FUTILITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0033)
FUTILITY AND FRUSTRATION ARE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0034)
HIS LOVERS LIKE HIS SOLDIERS ROT IN THE GRAVE DEFEATED OF THEIR GLORY	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0035)
LOVERS ARE ALWAYS SEVERED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0036)
IN BEYOND THE LAST LAMP WE HAVE THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OVER SEVERANCE	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0037)
NO SHADE OF PINNACLE OR TREE OR TOWER WHILE EARTH ENDURES WILL FALL ON MY MOUND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STEAL ON TO YOURS ONE ROBIN NEVER HAUNT OUR TWO GREEN COVERTURES	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0038)
THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN OUR OWN	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0039)
NOTHING OF TINIEST WORTH HAVE I WROUGHT PONDERED PLANNED NO ONE THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE LIKE BIRTH OF THIS DIURNAL UNIT BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF DULL HUED DAYS	(6123-59186-6123-59186-0040)
IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0000)
PENELOPE HAS STUDIED SO HARD ALL WINTER AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE THOUGHT THE OLDER SISTER WISTFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0001)
DORIS DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0002)
SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED DID PENELOPE THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED IT FOR THE WORLD	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0003)
SHE KNEW THAT PENELOPE HAD STARTED OUT TO SAY A NEW DRESS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0004)
DORIS HUNTER I BELIEVE IT'S AN OLD QUILT	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0005)
LISTEN PENELOPE MY DEAR DORIS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0006)
LOVE TO PENELOPE AND YOURSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0007)
YOUR AFFECTIONATE AUNT ADELLA HUNTER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0008)
I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WITH A GRIMACE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0009)
IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FADED NOW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0010)
TELL ME DORRIE DOES IT ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNTER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0011)
IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT ADELLA TO SEND IT SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0012)
WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PENELOPE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0013)
WHAT LOVELY OLD TIMEY STUFF AND NOT A BIT FADED	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0014)
I DECLARE IT IS AS GOOD AS NEW	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0015)
WELL LET US GO AND HAVE TEA SAID PENELOPE I'M DECIDEDLY HUNGRY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0016)
BESIDES I SEE THE POVERTY PUCKER COMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0017)
IT IS SOMETHING TO POSSESS AN HEIRLOOM AFTER ALL	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0018)
PENELOPE WAS SURPRISED AS MUCH AS THE TENDER SISTERLY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DORIS FLASHED OUT UPON HER TRIUMPHANTLY ON THE EVENING OF THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY PRESSED AND RE HUNG AND THE PRETTIEST WAIST IMAGINABLE A WAIST THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OF DAINTY ROSE BESPRINKLED SILK WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0019)
SO PENELOPE WENT TO BLANCHE'S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0020)
PENELOPE THOUGHT HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0021)
SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD PICTURE SHE SAID TO HERSELF	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0022)
MY AUNT ADELLA GAVE ME GAVE US THE MATERIAL SHE STAMMERED	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0023)
I AM NAMED AFTER HER MISSUS FAIRWEATHER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PENELOPE AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVELY OLD FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0024)
THEN YOU ARE MY GRANDNIECE SHE SAID	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0025)
WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT ROSEBUD SILK IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN THIBET	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0026)
PENELOPE WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0027)
SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSEHOLD WAS BROKEN UP	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0028)
MY DEAR I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0029)
NOW SHE PATTED MISSUS FAIRWEATHER'S SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0030)
DORIS AND PENELOPE FOUND THEIR LIVES AND PLANS CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0031)
WHEN MISSUS FAIRWEATHER HAD GONE DORIS AND PENELOPE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER	(6267-53049-6267-53049-0032)
AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER BLUE PRINT AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0000)
AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BABY CLINGING TO THE OTHER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0001)
SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND VULGAR AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0002)
I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BRIXBY IS THIS EVENING SIDDY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0003)
SIDNEY SIGHED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR THE BABY	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0004)
ALL HER DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DULLNESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0005)
BUT SHE DID RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE HER LETTER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0006)
THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN WHICH SIDNEY SHARED WITH TWO SMALL COUSINS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0007)
HER BED AND THE COT WHERE THE LITTLE GIRLS SLEPT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0008)
JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANGLE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN ORANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE SIZE OF A PEA AND THE MOUTH ZIGZAGGED FROM EAR TO EAR	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0009)
SIDNEY HATED THAT MIRROR AS VIRULENTLY AS SHE COULD HATE ANYTHING	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0010)
HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND SIDNEY THEREUPON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT JANE WITH THOSE BOOKS FOR HER DOWRY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXPENSES OF THE DOUBLE FUNERAL HAD BEEN PAID	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0011)
PRESENTLY SHE BEGAN TO WRITE WITH A FLUSH OF REAL EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0012)
ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO ELLEN DOUGLAS AND THAT WAS FORWARDED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFFERING EDITOR OF THE MAPLE LEAF	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0013)
HE WROTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DEBARRED HIM FROM MEMBERSHIP IN THE CLUB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIMIT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWERING SOME OF THE REQUESTS FOR CORRESPONDENTS	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0014)
HE NEVER HAD DONE SO BUT ELLEN DOUGLAS'S LETTER WAS SO INTERESTING THAT HE HAD DECIDED TO WRITE TO HER	(6267-65525-6267-65525-0015)

A EETES'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0013)
AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0014)
HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0015)
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE IMMORTALS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0016)
AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0017)
SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0018)
SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0019)
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARES YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0020)
THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0021)
IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0022)
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0023)
THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0024)
I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT IS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0025)
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0026)
PHRONTIS AND MELAS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS	(7641-96670-7641-96670-0027)
AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0000)
AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0001)
THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0002)
THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0003)
A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0004)
BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0005)
WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0006)
BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0007)
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0008)
ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0009)
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0010)
IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0011)
AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0012)
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0013)
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0014)
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0015)
ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0016)
THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0017)
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0018)
NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0019)
IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0020)
AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0021)
DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0022)
NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0023)
HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0024)
NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0025)
AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0026)
TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0027)
AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0028)
I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0029)
WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0030)
AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0031)
HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0032)
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0033)
AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0034)
SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0035)
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0036)
THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PANGS ENOUGH	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0037)
THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE	(7641-96684-7641-96684-0038)
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0000)
CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0001)
CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0002)
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0003)
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0004)
CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0005)
THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0006)
CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0007)
THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO IS SIN MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0008)
JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0009)
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0010)
CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SANG AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLEST CROSS BLEST TOMB	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0011)
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0012)
CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0013)
FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0014)
KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GET IN THE SAME IS A THIEF	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0015)
THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0016)
YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0017)
AND IF WE GET IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0018)
IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0019)
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0020)
NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0021)
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0022)
TIMOROUS SAID THAT ZION WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0023)
YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0024)
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0025)
HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0026)
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SCROLL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0027)
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR EASE THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF THE HILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0028)
SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0029)
HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0030)
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCROLL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0031)
WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROLL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0032)
HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0033)
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLIMB THE HILL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0034)
AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGE IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0035)
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0036)
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0037)
KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0038)
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0039)
CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0040)
WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0041)
THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0042)
PIETY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0043)
CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0044)
PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT ZION	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0045)
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0046)
CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0047)
CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0048)
BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0049)
THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH THESE FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0050)
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GOLIATH OF GATH	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0051)
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0052)
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IMMANUEL'S LAND	(7697-105815-7697-105815-0053)
MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0000)
JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0001)
THEN THE JUDGE TO SUM UP THE CASE SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIR IN OUR TOWN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0002)
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0003)
COME GOOD HOPEFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0004)
SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0005)
HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0006)
HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0007)
CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0008)
THEN SAID GIANT DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0009)
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAULT	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0010)
AND BY THIS ACT WE KILL OUR SOULS AS WELL	(7697-105817-7697-105817-0011)
FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0000)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0001)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DISOBEYED NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0002)
SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0003)
THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0004)
NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICIPATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0005)
THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0006)
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0007)
THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0008)
SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE OBEYED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0009)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0010)
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OBEYED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0011)
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DOMINION OVER PLANTS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0012)
NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0013)
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0014)
THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0015)
INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0016)
OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0017)
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0018)
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0019)
SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS	(7697-245712-7697-245712-0020)
BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0000)
ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0001)
THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER	(7697-245715-7697-245715-0002)
