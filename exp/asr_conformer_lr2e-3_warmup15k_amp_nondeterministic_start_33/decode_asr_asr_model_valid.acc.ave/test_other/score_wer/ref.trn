ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAHMAN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0000)
THE BRAHMAN ANSWERED NO I WILL NOT FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0001)
OH FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0002)
I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0003)
THEN THE BRAHMAN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID NOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0004)
SO THE BRAHMAN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANYAN TREE AND THE BRAHMAN SAID TO IT BANYAN TREE BANYAN TREE HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0005)
ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE BANYAN TREE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0006)
THIS TIGER SAID THE BRAHMAN BEGGED ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HURT ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LET HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0007)
IS IT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NO	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0008)
LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0009)
SIR CAMEL SIR CAMEL CRIED THE BRAHMAN HEAR AND GIVE JUDGMENT	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0010)
AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0011)
IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0012)
LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN HAVE NO PITY	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0013)
THREE OUT OF THE SIX HAD GIVEN JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAHMAN BUT STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0014)
ON WHAT MUST I GIVE JUDGMENT ASKED THE EAGLE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0015)
THE BRAHMAN STATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMB THE ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0016)
THEN THE TIGER BEGAN TO ROAR AND SAID THE JUDGMENT OF ALL IS AGAINST YOU O BRAHMAN	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0017)
AFTER THIS THEY SAW AN ALLIGATOR AND THE BRAHMAN RELATED THE MATTER TO HIM HOPING FOR A MORE FAVORABLE VERDICT	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0018)
BUT THE ALLIGATOR SAID WHENEVER I PUT MY NOSE OUT OF THE WATER MEN TORMENT ME AND TRY TO KILL ME	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0019)
THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH JUDGE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0020)
NOW THE SIXTH WAS A JACKAL	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0021)
THE BRAHMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL UNCLE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0022)
SHOW ME THE PLACE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0023)

WHERE WAS THE TIGER THEN	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0027)
WHY I STOOD SO SAID THE TIGER JUMPING INTO THE CAGE AND MY HEAD WAS ON THIS SIDE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0028)
VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0029)
SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAHMAN	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0030)
THEN SHUT AND BOLT IT SAID THE JACKAL	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0031)
WHEN THE BRAHMAN HAD DONE THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0032)
WHEN THE GOOD BRAHMAN OPENED YOUR CAGE DOOR IS TO EAT HIM THE ONLY RETURN YOU WOULD MAKE	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0033)
PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND BRAHMAN	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0034)
YOUR ROAD LIES THAT WAY AND MINE THIS	(2414-159411-2414-159411-0035)
THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY COQUETTE AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLUTTERING COXCOMB BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILIZED MONKEY	(2414-165385-2414-165385-0000)
THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS SENTENCED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE MIMICK WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU	(2414-165385-2414-165385-0001)
THEN MOSES WAS AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0000)
HOLD ON HOLD FAST HOLD OUT PATIENCE IS GENIUS	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0001)

THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0003)
EVERY ONE WHO IS TURBULENT HAS BEEN FOUND BY KING MERNEPTAH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVES REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIAN INSCRIPTIONS GIVE OF THE PERIOD	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0004)
THE ABSENCE OF DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0005)
IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES WHICH ULTIMATELY COALESCED INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0006)
THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THE TRADITIONAL FATHER OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH IMPLY THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES POSSIBLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF ACTORS IN THIS OPENING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0007)
THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES APPARENTLY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF THE SOJOURN IN EGYPT	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0008)
THE LATER TRADITIONS TEND TO EXTEND THE PERIOD	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0009)
HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BEARING THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY P ATUM HOUSE OF THE GOD ATUM	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0010)
A CONTEMPORARY INSCRIPTION ALSO STATES THAT HE FOUNDED NEAR PITHUM THE HOUSE OF RAMSES A CITY WITH A ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0011)
THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS TYRANNY WAS NATURAL INEVITABLE	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0012)

THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0014)

NATURALLY HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0018)
THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAD FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIAN FUGITIVES	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0019)
FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B C	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0020)
ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS HE FOUND CERTAIN BEDOUIN HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0021)
THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF KEDEM EAST OF THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0022)
LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0023)
THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0024)
THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF SINUHIT	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0025)
THE PRIEST OF THE SUB TRIBE OF THE KENITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0026)

AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN OF THEM WENT UP WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0029)
MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAW THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KENITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWEH OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER JEWISH SCRIBES JEHOVAH	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0030)
DO THE EARLIEST HEBREW TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0031)
THE TITLE OF HIS FATHER IN LAW IMPLIES THAT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME WILDERNESS SANCTUARY	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0032)
MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIEST WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE JEHOVAH WORSHIP	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0033)
THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0034)
HIS QUEST WAS FOR A JUST AND STRONG GOD ABLE TO DELIVER THE OPPRESSED	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0035)
THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES AND THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENED HIS SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0036)
THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST ANTOLIAN PLAIN IN CENTRAL ASIA MINOR STILL CALL EVERY LIFE GIVING SPRING GOD HATH GIVEN	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0037)
THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND OF DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION	(2609-156975-2609-156975-0038)
EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION WAS TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THE ROYAL FOE OF TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT	(2609-157645-2609-157645-0000)

SOMETIMES TOBACCO WAS USED IN CHURCH FOR DISINFECTING OR DEODORIZING PURPOSES	(2609-157645-2609-157645-0002)
BLACKBURN ARCHBISHOP OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER	(2609-157645-2609-157645-0003)
ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH NOTTINGHAM FOR A CONFIRMATION	(2609-157645-2609-157645-0004)
ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR AN INVETERATE SMOKER WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DISNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP BLACKBURN FROM DOING HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON	(2609-157645-2609-157645-0005)
PARR WAS SUCH A CONTINUAL SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY IF HE HAD NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENCE	(2609-157645-2609-157645-0006)

GOING TO CHURCH AT HAYES IN THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE AN EXCITING EXPERIENCE	(2609-157645-2609-157645-0013)
WHEN THESE MEN IN THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE FOUND THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE CUSTOM THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS	(2609-157645-2609-157645-0014)
PROAS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY DISTRUSTED BY SHIPS IT IS TRUE BUT THE SEA IS FULL OF THEM AND FAR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN ARE GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0000)
AN HOUR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR THAT JUST KEPT STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0001)
FORTUNATELY THE JOHN WAS NOT ONLY FAST BUT SHE MINDED HER HELM AS A LIGHT FOOTED GIRL TURNS IN A LIVELY DANCE	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0002)
I NEVER WAS IN A BETTER STEERING SHIP MOST ESPECIALLY IN MODERATE WEATHER	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0003)
MISTER MARBLE HE I DO BELIEVE WAS FAIRLY SNOOZING ON THE HEN COOPS BEING LIKE THE SAILS AS ONE MIGHT SAY BARELY ASLEEP	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0004)
AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A NOISE ONE FAMILIAR TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FALLING IN A BOAT	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0005)
I SANG OUT SAIL HO AND CLOSE ABOARD	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0006)
HE WAS TOO MUCH OF A SEAMAN TO REQUIRE A SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0007)
ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0008)
AS OUR SHEETS WERE ALL FLYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0009)
I SOON SAW BOTH PROAS AND GLAD ENOUGH WAS I TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEARER	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0010)
MISTER KITE OBSERVED THIS ALSO AND REMARKED THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE RASCALS ABACK	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0011)

THEY WERE LIKE THE YELLS OF FIENDS IN ANGUISH	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0022)
I DOUBT IF WE TOUCHED A MAN IN THE NEAREST PROA	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0023)
IN THIS STATE THE SHIP PASSED AHEAD ALL HER CANVAS BEING FULL LEAVING THE PROA MOTIONLESS IN HER WAKE	(2609-169640-2609-169640-0024)
THEY SWARMED UP IN FRONT OF SHERBURN'S PALINGS AS THICK AS THEY COULD JAM TOGETHER AND YOU COULDN'T HEAR YOURSELF THINK FOR THE NOISE	(3005-163389-3005-163389-0000)
SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE	(3005-163389-3005-163389-0001)
THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCOMFORTABLE	(3005-163389-3005-163389-0002)

THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BETHUNE A JANSENIST TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER AH	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0030)
THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0031)
A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM MORE OFTEN	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0032)
HEY MORE OFTEN	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0033)

I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0035)
REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0036)
BUT I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0037)
AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0038)
AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR SAID THE PRIORESS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0039)
IT CUT MORE OFTEN SHORT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0040)
FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0041)
IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIXION MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0042)
FATHER FAUVENT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0043)
SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0044)
SHE GAVE US HER LAST COMMANDS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0045)
IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HER CELL SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0046)
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0047)
FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS AN ORISON WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0048)
FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT ON	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0049)
I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABORING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0050)
FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0051)
SHE CONTINUED FATHER FAUVENT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0052)
YES REVEREND MOTHER	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0053)
SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORT WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARRICIDES IN THE HOPE THAT PASSERS BY WOULD SPIT ON HIS TOMB THIS WAS DONE	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0054)
THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED SO BE IT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0055)
FOR THAT MATTER NO REVEREND MOTHER	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0056)
FATHER FAUVENT MOTHER CRUCIFIXION WILL BE INTERRED IN THE COFFIN IN WHICH SHE HAS SLEPT FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT IS JUST	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0057)

THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED TO BE BURIED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL NOT TO GO TO PROFANE EARTH TO REMAIN THERE IN DEATH WHERE SHE PRAYED WHILE LIVING SUCH WAS THE LAST WISH OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0068)
SHE ASKED IT OF US THAT IS TO SAY COMMANDED US	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0069)
BUT IT IS FORBIDDEN	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0070)

I HAVE ON MY RIGHT BENOIT AND ON MY LEFT BERNARD WHO WAS BERNARD	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0080)

WE LIVE IN TIMES OF TERRIBLE CONFUSION	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0087)
WE ARE IGNORANT AND IMPIOUS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0088)
AND THEN RELIGION IS ATTACKED WHY	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0089)
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN BAD PRIESTS BECAUSE SAGITTAIRE BISHOP OF GAP WAS THE BROTHER OF SALONE BISHOP OF EMBRUN AND BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM FOLLOWED MOMMOL	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0090)
THEY PERSECUTE THE SAINTS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0091)
THEY SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH DARKNESS IS THE RULE	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0092)

THE OFFICE FOR THE DEAD WILL THEN BE SAID	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0100)
BUT SHE WILL HEAR SHE WILL NOT LISTEN	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0101)
BESIDES WHAT THE CLOISTER KNOWS THE WORLD LEARNS NOT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0102)

THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE NO SUSPICION	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0122)
THE EMPTY COFFIN REMAINS THIS PRODUCED A PAUSE	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0123)
WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THAT COFFIN FATHER FAUVENT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0124)
IT WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EARTH EMPTY	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0125)
AH THE DE EXCLAIMED FAUCHELEVENT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0126)
THE VIL STUCK FAST IN HIS THROAT	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0127)
HE MADE HASTE TO IMPROVISE AN EXPEDIENT TO MAKE HER FORGET THE OATH	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0128)
I WILL PUT EARTH IN THE COFFIN REVEREND MOTHER THAT WILL PRODUCE THE EFFECT OF A CORPSE	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0129)
I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS	(3528-168669-3528-168669-0130)
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
FOURTEEN NINETY NINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WILL BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICERE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGNS OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
ICES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THE SPADDLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME GIRL SAID THE HEAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)
COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0007)
THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0008)

I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDERLAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0013)
AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0014)

CINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0018)

I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED CINDERLAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0024)
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0000)
THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0001)
BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0002)
SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0003)
THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0004)
HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGONS SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0005)
THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0006)
ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0007)
SO REGIN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0008)
THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGIN	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0009)
SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0010)
THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0011)
BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0012)
SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0013)
BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0014)
DIE THOU FAFNIR AND THEN FAFNIR DIED	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0015)
THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGIN AND REGIN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNIR'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0016)
SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNIR ON A STAKE AND ROASTED IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0017)
THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNIR'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0018)
THAT LET HIM DO AND THEN RIDE OVER HINDFELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BRYNHILD SLEEPS	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0019)
THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0020)
THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0021)
THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0022)
THEN BRYNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNAR THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNAR SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0023)
FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRYNHILD AND GUDRUN WERE BATHING BRYNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUIRUN'S SUPERIOR	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0024)
FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0025)
NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD	(3538-163624-3538-163624-0026)

A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0014)
FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0015)
JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0016)
WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0017)

HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0019)
THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0020)
HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0021)

FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS THAT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0026)

FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED GRIBIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0036)

FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT I AM LOST	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0043)
THEY WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUNS CORNER	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0044)
AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0045)
FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0046)
MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRYTANEUM TOWN HALL	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0047)
BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0048)

FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0052)
THE GRAVE DIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0053)
ONE MUST EAT	(3764-168671-3764-168671-0054)
THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I WAKE	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0000)
YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0001)
WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0002)
THERE ARE BOLTS ON THE DOOR WRETCH	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0003)
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0004)
NOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0005)

EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNSELS OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0007)
THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0008)
THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERIOUS VEIL	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0009)
WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HAVE BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0010)
THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0011)
WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0012)

IT IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SERIOUSLY	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0015)
BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DRAUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0016)
BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LIAISON	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0017)
WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0018)
THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0019)
HOW WHY	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0020)
MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0021)

ONLY ONE REMAINED EMPTY THE STAGE BOX	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0025)
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0026)
DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0027)
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0028)

WHERE AT HOME	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0030)
YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0031)
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0032)
NONETHELESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WAITING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR	(3997-180294-3997-180294-0033)

YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0001)
WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0002)
DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0003)
MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0004)
YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0005)
BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0006)
IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0007)
IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0008)
HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0009)
I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0010)
WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0011)
I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0012)
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN'S DESIRE HAS INDEED LIMITS WHEN SATISFIED AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0013)
TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRES AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0014)
WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0015)
WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0016)
WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEM LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0017)
NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0018)
IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE IN OUR CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THEATRE	(3997-180297-3997-180297-0019)

THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0013)
HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROYED THE WEB AND GAVE THE FLY ITS FREEDOM	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0014)
A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0015)
THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0016)
AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0017)
IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0018)
WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0019)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0020)
MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVERRIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0021)
THE GRANDAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNCILLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND TO BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0022)
TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0023)
AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0024)
BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0025)
SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE CISEAUX	(4294-35475-4294-35475-0026)
HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM AND THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVE LATER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0000)
HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0001)
HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0002)
TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKER'S	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALNUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE YAUSKY BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
HE ASKED AH IT IS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED IS MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION AND NOT FOR LOWERING IT	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE KNOW NOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASSES AN OPPRESSOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)

MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0005)
WELL HE ADMITTED I DID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0006)
CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGING INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
BETCHA AREN'T GOIN AFTER ALL CHRIS TURNED ON HIM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0011)
MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0012)
AW SHUCKS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0013)
CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0014)
AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0015)
THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUBS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0016)
A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0017)
THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH HIS JOB	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0018)
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0019)
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0020)
THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0021)
ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0022)
BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0023)
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0024)
HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0025)
A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0026)
OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0000)
SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0001)
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0002)
HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0003)
MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0004)
THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEKBONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0005)
LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0006)
CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0007)
CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0008)
YES SIR HE SAID	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0009)
I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0010)
HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0011)
JAKEY HARRIS HIS NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0012)
I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0013)
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0014)
HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0015)
WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKEY'S GETTING THE JOB SIR	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0016)
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0017)
THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0018)
THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0019)
THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0020)
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0021)
IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0022)
THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0023)
FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0024)
NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETS	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0025)
WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUGSTORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0026)
A COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0027)
THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0028)
A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0029)
THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0030)
MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE	(4852-28312-4852-28312-0031)
THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0000)
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0001)
CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0002)
ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0003)
WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0004)
HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0005)
SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0006)
MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0007)
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0008)
THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0009)
HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0010)
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED CLOSE BY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0011)
SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0012)
THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED UP POINTING TOES	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0013)
THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0014)
IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0015)
HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0016)
BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0017)
CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0018)
HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY CHRIS RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0019)
THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0020)
DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0021)
CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0022)
MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0023)
WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0024)
IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0025)
UNDER HIS EYES THE WOODEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0026)
THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL	(4852-28319-4852-28319-0027)
THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0000)
GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0001)
NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ELBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0002)
IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0003)
THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0004)
WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0005)
CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0006)
CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0007)
MISTER FINNEY WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0008)
HIS FACE FROZE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0009)
THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0010)
THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0011)
THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0012)
HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0013)
WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0014)
THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0015)
YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0016)
CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN HIS WINNING SMILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0017)
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0018)
CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0019)
WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS THOUGHT TO ASK	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0020)
I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0021)
I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0022)
NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0023)
HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0024)
THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE	(4852-28330-4852-28330-0025)
WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN	(533-1066-533-1066-0000)
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD	(533-1066-533-1066-0001)
I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I HAVE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT	(533-1066-533-1066-0002)
FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVES WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THE LODGE	(533-1066-533-1066-0003)
OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES	(533-1066-533-1066-0004)
MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0005)
I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY	(533-1066-533-1066-0006)
I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL	(533-1066-533-1066-0007)
THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0008)
SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID	(533-1066-533-1066-0009)
PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING	(533-1066-533-1066-0010)
LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0011)
THEY WERE TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED	(533-1066-533-1066-0012)
THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE THE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE HALL LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT	(533-1066-533-1066-0013)
I ASKED NO QUESTIONS	(533-1066-533-1066-0014)
ONCE ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STEWART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE	(533-1066-533-1066-0015)
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED	(533-1066-533-1066-0016)
THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHEN WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT	(533-1066-533-1066-0017)
I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT	(533-1066-533-1066-0018)
IN SPITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHARPLY	(533-1066-533-1066-0019)
IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES	(533-1066-533-1066-0020)
THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED	(533-1066-533-1066-0021)
THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY	(533-1066-533-1066-0022)
A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE HANDIER AT BURYING FOLKS THAN AT DIGGING THEM UP	(533-1066-533-1066-0023)
I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN	(533-1066-533-1066-0024)
BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO	(533-131556-533-131556-0000)
FOR NONE COULD INJURE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH	(533-131556-533-131556-0001)
THE WORD STARES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0002)
I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED	(533-131556-533-131556-0003)
I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD THEM SO MINUTELY	(533-131556-533-131556-0004)
THEY HAD BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION HAD PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK	(533-131556-533-131556-0005)
I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT	(533-131556-533-131556-0006)
UPON PERUSING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP	(533-131556-533-131556-0007)
YOU MAY GO MILICENT AND SHE'LL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILICENT WENT	(533-131556-533-131556-0008)
WILL YOU OBLIGE ME HELEN CONTINUED SHE	(533-131556-533-131556-0009)
AH YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS	(533-131556-533-131556-0010)
IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE	(533-131556-533-131556-0011)
I ENJOY A MOONLIGHT RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HER AND THE SHRUBBERY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVOURITE RESORTS	(533-131556-533-131556-0012)
SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT PRESSING HER FINGER AGAINST HER TEETH AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE	(533-131556-533-131556-0013)
I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY	(533-131556-533-131556-0014)
YES YES	(533-131556-533-131556-0015)
SUPPOSE I DO	(533-131556-533-131556-0016)
SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW	(533-131556-533-131556-0017)
I CANNOT RENOUNCE WHAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE	(533-131556-533-131556-0018)
IF YOU ARE GENEROUS HERE IS A FITTING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EXERCISE OF YOUR MAGNANIMITY IF YOU ARE PROUD HERE AM I YOUR RIVAL READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE MYSELF YOUR DEBTOR FOR AN ACT OF THE MOST NOBLE FORBEARANCE	(533-131556-533-131556-0019)
I SHALL NOT TELL HIM	(533-131556-533-131556-0020)
GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I REFRAIN	(533-131556-533-131556-0021)

LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CROWN	(5442-32873-5442-32873-0017)
LUKE STUCK ON HIS GREASY WIDEAWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DOG CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LANE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP UNDER STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AT UNSEASONABLE HOURS	(5442-32873-5442-32873-0018)
IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR	(5442-32873-5442-32873-0019)
THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0000)
HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER RING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0001)
HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COURSE SERGEY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0002)
SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR ORDER A BALLOT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0003)
WE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0004)
THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NO CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARSHAL HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0005)

THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0007)
LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOUT FLEROV SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0008)
HE FORGOT AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF VOTES THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF VOTES IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURE THE RECOGNITION OF FLEROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0009)
BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0010)
TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0011)
HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED HIS SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JEERED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0012)
LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0013)
SERGEY IVANOVITCH FROWNED	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0014)
THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0015)
HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0016)

BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0020)

IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0023)
AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0024)
THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION	(5442-41168-5442-41168-0025)

HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0001)
HE'S SUCH A BLACKGUARD	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0002)
I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0003)
THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0004)
SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE CHAMPAGNE	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0005)

THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0010)
IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0011)
AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0012)
THEY'RE PROPRIETORS OF A SORT BUT WE'RE THE LANDOWNERS	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0013)
THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0014)
IF WE'RE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU'VE A TREE THAT'S STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWERBEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0015)

SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0020)
WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASSILIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0021)
TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0022)
HERE YOU'VE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0023)
YOU'RE MARRIED I'VE HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0024)
YES IT'S RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0025)
THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MUSTACHES	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0026)
WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PARKS FOR TIMBER	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0027)
SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0028)
THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHTN'T TO DO	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0029)
THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0030)
WITHOUT A RETURN TOO AT A SIMPLE LOSS	(5442-41169-5442-41169-0031)
WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0000)
BUT HERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANOR	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0001)
SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0002)
SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0003)
THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0004)
HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0005)
SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0006)
THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT AROUSED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0007)
THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0008)
HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0009)
WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATEUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED	(5484-24317-5484-24317-0010)

ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0015)
IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0016)
THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0017)
COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIEN	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0018)
WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS	(6070-86745-6070-86745-0019)
THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN ITS PAGES	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0000)
THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0001)
SHE IS WILLING TO RISK THAT	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0002)

HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0004)
IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0005)
THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0006)
THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0007)
AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANTS AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELISIONS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0008)
AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0009)
WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPERS AND ROARING RADICALS	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0010)

SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0013)
HAVE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0014)
NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0015)
SHE HATES IT SHE WOULD LIKE TO ABOLISH IT	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0016)

ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0020)
BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0021)
THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0022)
SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0023)
HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0024)
HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0025)
I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0026)
MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE	(6128-63240-6128-63240-0027)
POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0000)
THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0001)
RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0002)
HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0003)
SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0004)
HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0005)
THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0006)
IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0007)
IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HOW SUCH AN OFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0008)
OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0009)
SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0010)
SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BASIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0011)
HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0012)
OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE EMOTION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BASIL RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND	(6128-63241-6128-63241-0013)

WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT REFORMERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0003)
OLIVE HATED TO HEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0004)
ALL SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE LIVED THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FARRINDER WHO LIVED AT ROXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0005)
SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINDER SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0006)
SHE WISHED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0007)
THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO	(6128-63244-6128-63244-0008)

RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0047)

NO ALIMONY REPEATED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0058)
AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW	(6432-63722-6432-63722-0059)
CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0000)
AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREEL COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0001)

WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0005)
IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0006)
IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF THE BASER SORT	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0007)
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0008)
THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0009)
AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0010)
HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0011)
SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0012)
BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENSE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0013)
LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0014)
SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0015)
NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0016)
AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0017)
STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0018)
THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0019)
IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0020)
GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0021)
LARCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0022)
IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0023)
AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RATCHFORD HAD MARRIED	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0024)
TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0025)
AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0026)
SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0027)
AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0028)
THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0029)
BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0030)
IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0031)
MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0032)
DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0033)
I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME	(6432-63723-6432-63723-0034)

MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL COYNESS	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0034)
PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY GOOD LORD	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0035)
DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A KLEPTOMANIAC LIKE COUSIN SNATCHER	(7105-2340-7105-2340-0036)

HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0008)
IT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0009)
COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0010)
I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0011)

NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0013)
THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0014)
TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0015)
THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0016)
NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0017)
YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0018)
NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0019)
SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOZE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0020)
A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0021)
HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0022)
BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0023)
A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS	(7902-96591-7902-96591-0024)

TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0004)
THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHY RAYSTOKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0005)
WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0006)
BUT HOW QUEER FOR MISTER GURR TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT TO ANDREW TEAL THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0007)
AND WHY DID ANDY CALL MISTER GURR FATHER	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0008)
THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0009)
AND I'M HUNGRY TOO TIME I WAS UP I SUPPOSE	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0010)

WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TELL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER BOAT	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0012)
ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0013)
OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARD THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONE WORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN INSTEAD	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0014)

HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS AND GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALISED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0029)
THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ASSAILING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH	(7902-96592-7902-96592-0030)
