GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONNECTIONARY ICES AND DESERT DISHES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0000)
THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0001)
FRUIT GATHERED IN WETTER FOLLY WEATHER WILL SOON BE BUILDED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0002)
BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY OCCURS BY A GREAT ATTENTION ON CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0003)
A FEW DIPS A FINGER INTO THE SERVE AND APPLIED TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SERVE WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0004)
LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SUM THAT HAS RISEN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0005)
IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0006)
BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO THOSE OF MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CAME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0007)
FOURTEEN NINETY NINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0008)
WHILE THE MONTH THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE THAT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0009)
THE REASON OF THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ANSWER OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0010)
FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SERP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0011)
THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR UP AND ON A SEA AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THERE TURNED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0012)
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THE ORANGE AND WOMENSHIPS ARE PRESERVED	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0013)
MAMMALADES JAMES AND FRUIT PACES OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0014)
MARVELATES AND GEMS DIFFER A LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIKELY CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE POP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RHINES WITH SUGAR	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0015)
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0016)
IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVED MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAY IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBUTE UNLESS THE GAME IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0017)
CONVICTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0018)
IN SPEAKING OF CONVICTIONARY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBSORS AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOY WAS SUGAR WERE FORMLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFESSIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD COMFERSE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONVICTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY COZINE	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0019)
A THOUSAND AND WORN ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD REP PURCHASE FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE IN HOME	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0020)
HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESERTS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0021)
THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0022)
ICES	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0023)
AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0024)
THE BOTTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0025)
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THEIR PAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO REVOKE IN DISPOSITION	(3538-142836-3538-142836-0026)
THERE WAS ONE TILL THE TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0000)
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO IN HIS OWN BREAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0001)
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0002)
KISS ME GO SAID BAD	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0003)
WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0004)
THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0005)
AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0006)
WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0007)
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0008)
ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LENT HER A BRUSH	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0009)
SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0010)
OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER'S SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITED AND UNWEPT	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0011)
I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0012)
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOAL DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN THEY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0013)
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO IS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF	(3538-163619-3538-163619-0014)
WILL NOT SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOOLS ASKED THE KING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0000)
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE FOOLS AND THAT HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0001)
HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0002)
YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0003)
I HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0004)
THEN THE KING PROMISED IN THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0005)
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOOLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLIFF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTIFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0006)
COME ARTHUR COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COME YOUR HAIR	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0007)
THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LIKE THE FULLEST ROOM WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLIFF OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0008)
SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0009)
ON THE THIRD DAY SAID THE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0010)
THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE WHEN TENDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0011)
I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID CINDER LAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0012)
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER LAD	(3538-163622-3538-163622-0013)

TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO THAT LIKE SOULS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0003)
MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0004)
THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0005)
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HELP THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0006)
HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD DISCHARGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0007)
HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0008)
IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0009)
THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0010)
WE REQUEST HER FOR ACT TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0011)
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0012)
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0013)
SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0014)
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0015)
THAT WILL BE ENOUGH	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0016)
NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WE DO AFTER THAT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0017)
DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0018)
IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0019)
THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0020)
HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKERS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0021)
HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0022)
HELLO I'VE FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0023)
THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0024)
I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0025)
THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0026)
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND A SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0027)
MARIUS SENT BACK FOR THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0028)
AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT	(4294-9934-4294-9934-0029)
HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0000)
BEFORE HER HE DECIDED A SCATTER HIS PEARLS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0001)
THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SEND AGAINST KATE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0002)
WELL DOCTOR AND DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0003)
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0004)
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT ON WITH A SIGH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0005)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0006)
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MONETRICIAN NERVOUS ANXIETY AND SO LONG	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0007)
THE QUESTION SENDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS IT TO CROOK THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN IN TRADITION	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0008)
YES IT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THIS ALREADY PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0009)
BEG PARDON IS THE YOSKEY BRIDGE DONE IT OR SHALL I HAVE THE DRIVER ON	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0010)
HE ASKED AH IT IS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0011)
OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0012)
AND HOW ABOUT IT TOUR BRAG ASKED THE FAN DOCTOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0013)
WHAT IS WANTED AS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING TRADITION ENOUGH A LOWERING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0014)
THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0015)
BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING AT REMINISCENCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0016)
AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0017)
AH WELL THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0018)
PO TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0019)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM THAT PITIED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0020)
OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0021)
AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0022)
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0023)
SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0024)
IT SEEMS ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0025)
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0026)
THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0027)
NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN CHOKICHI HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0028)
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0029)
BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED IN A DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WASY PROBLEM	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0030)
FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0031)
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR AGAIN	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0032)
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHAT SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL	(4350-10919-4350-10919-0033)
EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIPLE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL WAR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0000)
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0001)
IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE ENTERS OF THE GROUP	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0002)
THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0003)
THE MAN WHO WAS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0004)
THE BASES OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0005)
THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAIN TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0006)
THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSED TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0007)
THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL HE IS THE BASIS OF POWER	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0008)
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND AMEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0009)
INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0010)
ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0011)
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN AND POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0012)
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS ON THE DISPOSITION OF MENTAL VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESSENED THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0013)
BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIKE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THIS STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0014)
IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0015)
AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0016)
BUT THIS CLASSIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0017)
INTERNAL ASSERTIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISENTIAN INDIVIDUALS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0018)
GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0019)
AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST WOMEN BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN MAKES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0020)
THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS HAS BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIME SUBDUED BY CONQUEST	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0021)
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0022)
FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSSIBLY CONFIRMS IT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0023)
THE UPPER CLASSORS KNOW THAT AN ARMY IF A FEW THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG ON PENCROFTENCEMEN THEY FEEL THAT THIS SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0024)
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSIONS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGED SWIFTS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF THE DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0025)
THE MEANING OF PREVIOUS SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVE TOILING MASSES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0026)
AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0027)
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THEM THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXCLUDING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENT IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS SLAVE SUBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0028)
AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT IS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOUR BRIGANDS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0029)
THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESUE POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0030)
EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SORT OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0031)
THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0032)
THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE THE UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS WHO OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0033)
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0034)
THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0035)
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORIOUSNESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0036)
BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE WERE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0037)
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED IT INDIVIDUAL TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTEING STRIKE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0038)
THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0039)
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0040)
BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT AND THAT	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0041)
GOVERNMENT ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0042)
THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE AND ALL THAT ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0043)
AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT ARE I MAKING THEM	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0044)
I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF ESTATES TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0045)
EXCEPT WITH THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0046)
WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THEY CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF INARMMA AND MORAL INFLUENCE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0047)
SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STAIN VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL SPACE PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0048)
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0049)
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0050)
THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0051)
THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CO OPERATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0052)
WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAYED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0053)
THE GOVERNMENT THAT TELLS WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT AS LABELS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0054)
AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSAND PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0055)
THE POWER OF THIS STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER AT SUCH ATTACKS	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0056)
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BIRDS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGES THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0057)
TO RESIST WITH NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AN EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0058)
SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AN OPPRESSOR	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0059)
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES	(4350-9170-4350-9170-0060)
SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0000)

WELL HE ADMITTED I DID	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0006)
CRISISED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0007)
THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT IN PURSUED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0008)
HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND THUS SKETCHED INTO THE STREET WAS NOT WHAT CRITICISM INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0009)
LIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT WHAT WANTS TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT EMBRAC WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED	(4852-28311-4852-28311-0010)
